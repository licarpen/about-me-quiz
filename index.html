            <h2>Projectile Motion in Physics</h2>
            <p> In introductory physics, we simplify the physical world, making assumptions that reduce complex problems to approachable approximations.  We typically assume the following: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>There is no air resistance.</li>
                <li>Acceleration due to gravity is constant.</li>
                <li>The projectile has no angular momentum.</li>
            </ol>   
            <p>Under these conditions, we can predict the motion of a ball using simple kinematic equations.  When you start to compare theoretical results to experimental ones, it become evident quickly that these assumptions prevent you from being able to model the <q>real world</q> with much accuracy.  When accounting for air resistance, the problem of a simple projectile is not so simple anymore.  Additionally, adding spin and elevation dependent gravity results in complex calculations.  The kinematic equations used in introductory physics courses require a condition of a constant force.  Eliminating air resistance results in this requirement being met, as the force of gravity is also assumed to be constant.  However, when air is introduced, a new force manifests itself; that of drag.  The drag force is proportional to the velocity squared.  Since velocity is constantly changing due to gravity, kinematic equations can no longer be used.  Instead, we can take an iterative approach. </p>
